Hello! I am Alyssa, a fourth-year Computer Science major at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). My interests are strongly rooted in front-end development and machine learning.

When I'm not diving deep into code, you'll likely find me on a basketball court or golf course! Both sports offer a perfect balance to technology-heavy days, allowing me to stay active and mentally refreshed. Besides this, I also love exploring new hobbies or skills. I find challenges like this very addicting.
